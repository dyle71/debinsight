# debinsight

A tool collecting installed files, dependency and reverse dependency 
information by the help of `apt-cache` and similar tools on Debian and 
dependent operating systems.

This is a mere exercise for me making a Python 3 tool with click, uvloop, 
async, await and venv which bears _some_ benefit for the user. It is not intended
to supersede a standard tool of the operating system.
